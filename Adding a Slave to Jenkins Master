SLAVE TASK:

   $ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Now edit the password configs by removing # (comment) in password authentication, which looks like (#PasswordAuthentication yes)
   Change it to (PasswordAuthentication yes) 

# Restart sshd ($ sudo service sshd restart) and set password to the user: (sudo passwd USER_NAME)
   $ sudo passwd ec2-user

# Login to the server using the password and create a directory which can be used as Jenkins Slave Workspace.
