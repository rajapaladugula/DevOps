--------------------------HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CERT USING SSL------------------------

1. Inorder to create a cert using open ssl. First, you need to install OPENSSL.
   http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/openssl.htm

2. After downloading, you need to install it and set some environmental variables. For that 
   open cmd prompt and enter 
   $ set OPENSSL_CONF=YOURPATH\OFOpenSSL-Win32\bin\openssl.cfg

3. Now you need to set path for the RAND file to a folder where you want your certificate to be
   created. To set that, open cmd prompt and enter 
   $ set RANDFILE=c:\demo\.rnd     Here Demo is a folder which i created to put my certificate in 
   that folder.

4. Now to open OPENSSL you need to enter the following command 
   $ c:\OpenSSL-Win32\bin\openssl.exe

5. Then you need to generate a 4096-bit long RSA key for our root CA and store it in a file 
   named ca.key. To do that we need to enter: 
   $ genrsa -out ca.key 4096

6. Then it will generate a private key. You can also password-protect the key by adding -des3 
   to the command above. 

7. After that we need to create a self signed root CA certificate. By entering the command: 
   $ req -new -x509 -days 1826 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
   Here -x509 -> Option used for self-signed certificate.
        1826 -> cert valid for 5 yrs 

8. Here after, you  need to enter some details like 
   COUNTRY NAME: US
   STATE OR PROVINCE NAME: MO 
   LOCALITY NAME: LS
   ORGANIZATION NAME: Some X
   ORGANISATION UNIT NAME: Some X
   COMMON NAME: X
   EMAIL: x@gmail.com

9. Next step is to create another certificate which is used as public certificate. So you need
   to generate another key for that.
   $ genrsa -out ia.key 4096

10. Key is generated. Now you need to req a new certificate for that key. 
   $ req -new -key ia.key -out ia.csr 

11. Here again you need to fill some details like above. But one thing to remember is that you
    shouldn't give same common name. 
    COUNTRY NAME: US
    STATE OR PROVINCE NAME: MO 
    LOCALITY NAME: LS
    ORGANIZATION NAME: Some X
    ORGANISATION UNIT NAME: Some X
    COMMON NAME: Y (Coz, Shouldn't give same common name) 
    EMAIL: x@gmail.com

12. Now you need to process the request for the subordinate CA certificate and get signed it 
    by the root CA. i.e. Just to link this pubilc cert to private cert. To do so :
    $ x509 -req -days 730 -in ia.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out ia.crt

13. Now to use this keys for digital signatures with microsoft's signtool, You need to package
    the keys and cert. 
    $ pkcs12 -export -out ia.p12 -inkey ia.key -in ia.crt -chain -CAfile ca.crt

14. If you used the same common names above. You'll get error here saying 
    Error self signed certificate getting chain.
    error in pkcs12

15. Done!
