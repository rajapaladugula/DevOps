SSH Troubleshooting:
-------------------
1. Check any on going N/W issues in the region? (Try other servers)
2. Host Name Resolution error. (Typo in host name?, Try 'ping', Host name/Service doesnt exist!)
3. Connection Time out (SSH listening on 22? check /etc/ssh/sshd_config,
    Firewall Rules? check firewall-cmd --list-services/ports | iptables -nL
4. Connection Refused? (SSH Service Running? service ssh status, listening on 22?)
