1. SSH Troubleshooting: (https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/resources/troubleshooting-ssh/connectivity/)
    a) Check any on going N/W issues in the region? (Try other servers)
    b) Host Name Resolution error. (Typo in host name?, Try 'ping', Host name/Service doesnt exist!)
    c) Connection Time out (SSH listening on 22? check /etc/ssh/sshd_config,
            Firewall Rules? check firewall-cmd --list-services/ports | iptables -nL
    d) Connection Refused? (SSH Service Running? service ssh status, listening on 22?)
2. Lists Top 10 directories eating disk space in File System /etc
    du -ah /etc/ | sort -n -r | head -n 10
3. System Information: uname -a
4. Ip address: if config, ip addr
5. Disk free: df -ah
6. Disk usage: du -ah
7. Memory: free, vmstat
8. Manage services: service <NAME> status, systemctl status <NAME>
9. Check open ports: netstat -tulpn
10. CPU Usage: top, htop
11. Mounts: mount <VOLUMR_PATH> <MOUNT_POINT> ex: mount /dev/sda1 /opt
    Mount volume at boot: /etc/fstab
12. Zombie process: Child process whose parent is exited. Its process is in terminated state with resources unreleased.
                    Entry still in process table.
13. Role back stategy: Backup current artificat before deployment | Follow Blue-Green Deployments with testing endpoints inbetween.
14. Ansible/Chef:
      a) Agent-less | Agent, Agent-less
      b) ymal | Ruby
15. DR Strategy: a) Replica(Standby) of current Environment and DNS switch to D.B connection when required.
                 b) maintain multiple availability zones & Load Balancing traffic.
                 c) DNS based switch to route traffic on basis of health checks
16. Generate SSH Keys, Pass less auth: ssh-keygen -t rsa copy the generated public key to remote servers ~/.ssh/authorizedkeys
