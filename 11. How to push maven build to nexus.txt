   In pom.xml add the following :

   <distributionManagement>
   <snapshotRepository>
      <id>nexus-snapshots</id>
      <url>http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/YOUR-REPO-NAME/>
   </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>


And in <plugins> add the following : 

<plugin>
   <artifactId>maven-deploy-plugin</artifactId>
   <version>2.8.1</version>
   <executions>
      <execution>

Now go to settings.xml of maven ( If localhost Ex: C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.3.9\conf). In servers coloumn add the following:

<servers>
   <server>
      <id>nexus-snapshots</id>
