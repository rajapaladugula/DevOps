-------------- AUTOMAPPING LOGS FROM ES TO KIBANA USING FILEBEAT-------------------------


1. Here i tried to send tomcat's catalina logs to elastic search and then access those logs through kibana. 
   To do so i need to send catalina logs from filebeat to elastic search first. 

2. To do so, Open filebeat.yml file located in your filebeat directory. Open it with notepadd++  and edit the path
   column. 
 
3. Edit its path as (C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0\logs\catalina.*). This is because im 
   sending tomcat's catalina logs to elastic search.

4. Now set its output column as follows 
   
   output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  index: "devtomcat-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"

  # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
  protocol: "http"
  username: "elastic"
  password: "changeme"

5. It will create an index in elastic search as devtomcat- "date". You can check elastic search indices in browser 
   by opening elastic search (http://localhost:9200). Now a pop up will ask you user name and password which you 
   mentioned in filebeat.yml 

   USERNAME: elastic
   PASSWORD: changeme

6. Now to see the indices in elastic search type (http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v) in the browser. There you can
   see the index which we created using filebeat. If you dont see open run and type services.msc and restart both 
   tomcat and filebeat. 

7. Here when we restart tomcat, it will create a new catalina logs to generate. 

8. Now open kibana in browser (http://localhost:5601). It will ask you the same username and password. Enter them and 
   go to management -> Index pattern -> + -> In index name type devtomcat-* to locate the indeices that generate 
   with the name devtomcat-* . Here * is all that starts with devtomcat-

9. click index contain time based event and create index name pattern. Then an index pattern is created in the name 
   of devtomcat-* and you can see the catalina logs there.
