-------------- HOW TO GET SONARQUBE ANALYSIS AFTER A BUILD IN JENKINS------------------------

1. First you need to install sonarqube and sonar runner in the local host.

2. Go to sonarqube site and download sonarqube and sonar runner. Create a folder in localdisk:C named sonarqube
   and extract both sonarqube and runner to that folder. Now open Systemprop-> Advanced->Environment variables-> and set JAVA_HOME and JRE_HOME. 
   You also need to give sonar runner path in PATH of environmental variables.

3. Now go to sonarqube folder->bin->windows-x86 64bit-> click start sonar.bat . Then it will be done. 

4. To access sonarqube, open browser and type localhost:9000. 9000 port is prefixed for sonarqube.

5. Now open sonar runner->bin->sonar-runner. Then it will be installed.

6. Now open jenkins-> manage jenkins-> manage plugins-> available and search for sonar plugin and install it.

7. You need to configure sonar with jenkins. To do so you need to go to jenkins-> configure system-> there give
   any name -> enter sonar url i.e http://localhost:9000/ -> select server version as u wish. If you select 5.2
   then you need to give your credentials (or) if you select 5.3 you need to give server authentication token to it . 
   To get that token go to sonarqube->my account-> security-> generate a token u wish to.

8. Now open jenkins->global tool configuration-> and then configure JDK,GIT,MAVEN,SONARRUNNER. Configuring is 
   but giving their directory links. Here I configured MAVEN because my project is in MAVEN.
   (http://localhost:8080/configureTools/)

9. Now create a new job in jenkins and select the project type you want and then click ok. And give your git repo
   url in github and git column. 

10. Now under build trigger, Tick build whenever a snapshot dependency is build. Now go to prebuild and select 
    execute sonar scanner and in analysis property you need to give the following 
    (sonar.projectKey=AWS_SM_JavaRepo  
     sonar.projectName=${JOB_NAME}
     sonar.projectVersion=1.${BUILD_NUMBER}
     sonar.sources=src)
    There project key is anything you wish. But it should be unique.
          sonar sources is a folder where you code is in.

11. In the latest versions of sonarqube you need not to give any properties like above. Just you can tick PREPARE
    SONAR SCANNER ENVIRONMENT in the build environment step. So that jenkins will get all need to run sonar scanner.

12. Build. :) 


------------------------- QUALITY GATES TO SONARQUBE-------------------------------------

13. Now using quality gates to the above build.

14. You need to install qualitygates plugin in jenkins. Jenkins-> Manage jenkins-> Manage plugins

15. After installing plugins you need to go to the config in project and add quality gates to postbuild actions.

16. In sonarqube, qualitygate requirement will be given default. You can make changes to that default settings as u wish.

17. Build again. :D
