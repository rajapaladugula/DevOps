      HOW TO PULL AND PUSH REQ IN GIT USING COMMAND LINE

1) First you need to initialize git by using ($ git init). This will create .git directory. 

2) Now to add reference remote git url ($ git remote add origin your*git*repo*url)

3) Now you need to pull code by using ($ git pull origin midd) midd = branch. Then after check whether files got 
   pulled or not.

4) Now use insert command ($ vi filename) to do any changes needed and save it ($ esc :wq!)

5) Now after modification you need to do staging i.e need to add all files bye using ($ git add .)

6) Now before pulling you musy commit first ($ git commit -m "message")

7) Now try push command ($ git push origin midd) and authenticate. Then you will get some error. This is because
   your branch  reference is in remote not in HEAD. 

8) To check it you must use ref command ($ git show ref)

9) So you need to push midd reference as head to push the modified file ($ git push origin HEAD:midd)

10) It's done .. :)
