------------------------ HOW TO INSTALL AWS-CLI IN CENTOS------------------------------

1. First we need python for it.
      $ sudo yum install python-pip

2. Next we need pip. Pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in
   python.
      $ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

3. After downloading the pip package 
      $ sudo python get-pip.py

4. Now install aws cli using pip.
      $ sudo pip install awscli

5. Now we need to configure aws 
      $ aws configure 

6. It will ask for AWS ACCESS ID and AWS SECRET KEY. To get those keys click on your username on top right of ec2
   and select My Security credentials -> Continue to security credentials -> AccessID and secretKeys -> Create new 
   ACCESS KEY. Here for the first time we will not have any keys. So create a new one.

7. After creating, download the keys. We cant see them once we closed.

8. Now copy those keys in linux server
   Accesskey ID:
   SecretKey ID:
