Cluster: group of nodes configured to run a functioning KUBERNETES Systen.
Control plane: schedules containers onto nodes based on compute requirements.
PODS: lowest building block; group of one or more containers running on single node; 
SERVICES: defines n/w rules for exposing pods to other pods (or) public internet determined by a selector;
Selector: set of rules to match resources based on metadata; 
Label: key/value pair attached to resources; 
Annotation: non-identifying metadata for retrival by API clients such as tools & lib's; 
DEPLOYMENT: a declerative template (deployment config changes) for creating & scaling pods; 
ReplicationSet: coordinates pod creation, deletion and updates during deployments; 
Volume: a stateful block store for use with ephemeral pods to write persisted data; not a DB;  
Secret: senstive info such as passwords, OAuth tokens, ssh keys; 
StatefulSet: a pod with gurantees on deployment and scaling ordering; 
Request: desired amount of CPU or memory for a container in a pod; 
Resource: any individual KUBERNETES item such as deployment, pod, service or secret e.t.c,

kubectl:

kubectl create -f FILE : create a new KUBERNETES resources based on instructions in the FILE.
kubectl delete TYPE NAME : delete a particular resource --> kubectl delete POD my_pod
kubectl get TYPE : return all KUBERNETES resources of specified TYPE --> kubectl get PODS
kubectl describe TYPE NAME : prints detailed info about a particular resource --> kubectl describe POD my_pod
kubectl logs POD_NAME : print container logs for a particular pod;
