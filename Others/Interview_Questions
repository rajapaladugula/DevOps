1. SSH Troubleshooting: (https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/resources/troubleshooting-ssh/connectivity/)
    a) Check any on going N/W issues in the region? (Try other servers)
    b) Host Name Resolution error. (Typo in host name?, Try 'ping', Host name/Service doesnt exist!)
    c) Connection Time out (SSH listening on 22? check /etc/ssh/sshd_config,
            Firewall Rules? check firewall-cmd --list-services/ports | iptables -nL
    d) Connection Refused? (SSH Service Running? service ssh status, listening on 22?)

Firewall: (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-a-firewall-and-how-does-it-work)
A firewall is a system that provides network security by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of user-defined rules.

DevOps:
------
DevOps is a set of cultural norms and technology practices that enable the fast flow of planned work, right from development, through tests into operations while preserving
  world class reliability, operation and security that involves Continuous Development, Continuous Testing, Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment and Continuous
  Monitoring of the software throughout its development life cycle.
1. Need: Now a days, Instead of releasing big sets of features, companies are trying to see if small features can be transported to their customers through a series of release trains.
         This has many advantages like quick feedback from customers, better quality of software etc. which in turn leads to high customer satisfaction. In order to acheieve this, companies
         are required to: Increase deployment frequency, Lower failure rate of new releases, Shortened time between fixes, Faster mean time to recovery in the event of new release crashing.
         DevOps fulfills all these requirements and helps in achieving seamless software delivery.
2. Role back stategy: Backup current artificat before deployment | Follow Blue-Green Deployments with testing endpoints inbetween.
3. DR Strategy:  a) Replica(Standby) of current Environment and DNS switch to D.B connection when required.
                 b) maintain multiple availability zones & Load Balancing traffic.
                 c) DNS based switch to route traffic on basis of health checks.
4. Agile | DevOps:  a) Agility in Dev | both Dev & Operations
                    b) emphasize on timeliness | both timeliness & quality
                    c) feedback from customers | self-monitoring
                    d) practices: scrum, kanban | ci, cd, ct, cm

Configuration Management:
------------------------
1. Ansible/Chef:
      a) Agent-less | Agent, Agent-less
      b) ymal | Ruby

Terraform:
---------
		Tool for building, changing and versioning infrastructure as a Code safely and effectively.
1. Usecases: a) Disposable Env's (QA, UAT)
			 b) Mutli-Cloud Deployment (AWS, Azure)
			 c) n-tier Applications :  tiers can be scaled independently
			 d) Self-service Clusters(Developers, QA)
			 e) Resource Schedulars (K8) as providers
2. Providers: responsible for understanding API interactons and exposing resources (AWS, Azure, GCP, Grafana)
3. Resources: describes the infrastructure components such as virtual networks, instances...
4. Module: container for multiple resources used together. Every tf has atleast 'root' module.
5. Datasources: allows data to be fetched or computed defined outside of terraform, or defined by other tf module.
6. State: stores information about managed infrastructure and configuration. default location is "terraform.tfstate".
	Without state, Terraform has no way to identify the real resources it created during previous runs. Thus, when multiple
	people are collaborating on shared infrastructure, it's important to store state in a shared location backend.
	Supports Backends; gcs, s3...
7. workspaces: containers for state. used to manage Infrastructure environments(Dev, QA..) using same config files.
8. lifecycle: create_before_destroy, prevent_destroy, ignore_changes
9. Provisioners: used to execute scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation or destruction. (local, remote, chef, puppet, file)
10. Steps for EC2 creation: VPC, Subnets, Security Group, EC2 instances, Load Balancer, DNS
11. CLI: init - Initialize a Terraform working directory
		 plan - Generate and show an execution plan
		 validate - Validates the Terraform files
		 apply - Builds or changes infrastructure
		 destroy - Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure

Jenkins:
-------
Plugins: Git, SVN, Maven, Trigger build on other project, Deploy ear/war to container, UpStream/Downstream jobs, E-mail notification.
Pipeline: A Pipeline is a user-defined model of a CD pipeline. A Pipeline’s code defines your entire build process, which typically includes stages
	for building an application, testing it and then delivering it.
Pipeline Adv: User defined process, Pipeline as code in SCM, Audit trail for pipeline, Pausable(optionally stop and wait for human input or approval 
	before continuing the Pipeline run), perform work in parallel, multiple options for integration with other plugins.`
Node: a machine which is part of the Jenkins environment and is capable of executing a Pipeline.
Stage: a conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed through the entire Pipeline (e.g. "Build", "Test" and "Deploy" stages), which is used by 
	many plugins to visualize or present Jenkins Pipeline status/progress.
Step: A single task. Fundamentally, a step tells Jenkins what to do at a particular point in time (or "step" in the process)
	For example, to execute the shell command make use the sh step: sh 'make'.
Declarative: opens with a "pipeline" block with agent, stages and steps inside respective stages.
Scripted: opens with a "node" block with stages and steps inside respective stages.
Comparision: Scripted pipeline written in Groovy | Declarative pipeline doesnt require groovy; Starts with node block | starts with pipeline block;
			 uses declarative programming model| imperative programming model; provides richer syntactical features over Scripted Pipeline syntax

Es:
--
	It is a search engine based on Apache Lucene that supports full-text search engine to perform a fast
	incisive search over large chunks of data.
Adv: distributed, scalable and easy to integrate, compatible on any platform, supports every document type except text rendering.
	 find out anomalies on data based on pattern, send alerts when particular condition matched like exception from logs etc.
DisAdv: Elasticsearch does not support multiple languages while handling request and response data in JSON.
		In rare cases, it has a problem of Split Brain situations.
Split Brian: https://blog.trifork.com/2013/10/24/how-to-avoid-the-split-brain-problem-in-elasticsearch/
Index: An index in ES is similar to a db in relational databases. Its a collection of documents with similar characteristics and is identified by name.
	   An index maps one or more multiple shards and can have zero or many replica shards.
Type(Table): It is a logical category/partition of index. defined for docs that have a set of common fields.
Document(Row): A document in elastic search is a top level or a root component object that is serialized into JSON object and will be stored in Elastic search
	under a unique id. Documents in elastic search are indexed and stored and will be available to search using the index.
Inverted Index:  primary goal is to make very fast full-text searches, while finding the documents in which our search terms occur.
	Inverted index consists of a list of all unique words that occurs in documents and for each word, maintain a list of documents number and positions
	in which it appears. It is a hashmap like data structure that directs users from a word to a document or a web page.
Shards: Data in an index can be partitioned into multiple portions which are itself fully-functional and independent index managed by a separate node of ES.
		Each such portion is called a Shard. And an Elasticsearch index has 5 shards by default.
Replias: Each shard in elastic search has again two copies of the shard that are called the replicas.
		 They serve the purpose of fault tolerance and high availability.
Operations: Indexing, Fetch, delete, update
Cluster: collection of one or more nodes (servers) that together holds your entire data and provides federated indexing and search capabilities across all nodes. 
Node: It is a single server that is part of the cluster. It stores the data and participates in the clusters indexing and search capabilities.
	  A Master node is a node that controls the entire cluster. A data node is a node that holds data in it and performs logical operations on the data.
	  Ingest node pre-process(applies transformations) documents before the actual document indexing happens. The ingest node intercepts bulk and index requests.
Analyzer: While indexing data in ElasticSearch, data is transformed internally by the Analyzer defined for the index. Analyzers are composed of a single Tokenizer
		  and zero or more TokenFilters(lower case). The tokenizer may be preceded by one or more CharFilters. Ex: Whitespace, stop
Filters:  AND, EXISTS, OR
Schema: A schema is a structure that describes multiple fields that provides the detailed overview of the document and its type and the way of handling the fields inside the document.
Tokenizer: Tokenizers are used to break a string down into a stream of terms or tokens. A simple tokenizer might split the string up into terms wherever 
		   it encounters whitespace or punctuation. 
Document APIS::
Create/Update Index: PUT <Index_Name>
List Index: GET /<Index_Name>/<doc_name>
Delete Index: DELETE /<Index_Name>/<doc_name>
Search APIS:: GET /<Index_Name>/<doc_name>/_search?q=year:2001
Index APIS:: Indexes of Cluster: GET /<Index_Name>/indices
Cluster APIS: GET _cluster/health
Add mapping in index: POST website /_bulk
Elasticsearch REST API Uses: Check your cluster, node, and index health, status, and statistics.
							 Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) and search operations against your indexes.

Tomcat:
------
Best Practices: Run as a service
				download executable from the trusted source
				Enable SSL
				Secure the Tomcat Manager application
				Use Complex passwords
				create individual log file to each application
				encrypt passwords or sensible information
				Update error pages relavently
				Rotate the log files
				disable shutdown port
				Web Application Firewall
https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/apache-tomcat-interview-questions/


GitHub:
------
Best Practices: Don’t just git push directly to master. (turn on git branch protection to prevent direct commits)
				Commit early and often. (help understand how you broke something.)
				Avoid Rebase while sharing branch with other people.
				Do git commit with the right email address. (Having commits with unrecognized authors makes it more difficult to track )
				Define Code/Repo owners for faster code reviews.
				Don’t let secrets leak into source code. (inject secrets as environment variables; use Harshicorp Vault/AWS Secret Manager)
				Don’t commit dependencies into source code. (Use Nexus/Artifactory)
				Don’t commit configuration files into source code.
				Create a meaningful git ignore file. (helps to ignore pre-defined files liked secret keys)
				Archive dead repositories. (avoid risk of people using unmaintained repos)
				Lock package version. (specify a version or version range for every package and dependency listed in the manifest)
				Align packages versioning. (try at a minimum to use the same major version of the package.)

Networking:
----------
HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol used by web pages to transmit website content and allow for display & navigation of hypertext or links to web browser. Protocol: TCP; Port:80
HTTPS: Secure HTTP is designed to be used for identity verification. It uses SSL certs to verify the server connecting to. Protocol: TCP; Port: 443
FTP: File Transfer Protocol is primarily designed for large file transfers, with capability of resuming downloads if interrupted.
	 DisAdv: credentials of the user are transmitted in cleartext. SFTP (FTP over SSH) and FTPS (FTP with SSL) overcmes this issue. FTP uses TCP ports 20 and 21.
SSH: Secure Shell is designed to create secure tunnel between devices, so that even insecure programs can be used in secure state. TCP PORT 22
DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is default way for connecting up to a N/W. Upon connecting to a network, a DHCP request will be sent out from a new member system and
	  the DHCP server will respond and issue an address lease for a varying amount of time.  If the system connects to another network, it will be issued a new address by that server.
TCP: Transmission Control Protocol is used by HTTP, FTP, SSH and many other. TCP establishes connection on both ends before any data begins to flow. It is also able to sync up the
	 data flow so that if packet arrives out of order, the receiving system is able to figure out what the packet is supposed to look like.
UDP: User Datagram Protocol is connectionless protocol, which doesnt care if other end is listening. faster transmission spped than TCP. Ex; Telivision broadcast
ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol primary purpose is to tell systems when they are trying to connect remotely if the other end is available. used by PING.
OSI Layers: Physical, Datalink, N/w, Transport, Session, Presentation and Application

Firewall: is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on pre-determined security rules. can be both S/W(IPTables, FirewallD)
		  Rules - ACCEPT, DROP and REJECT. and H/W(Routers). (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-a-firewall-and-how-does-it-work)
		  Flush IP Tables (Temp) - iptables -f ; permanent: service iptables save; /etc/sysconfig/iptables: iptables 
Proxy server: is a computer on the web that redirects your web browsing activity under a different IP address identity not revealing their true access point to website.
Subnet: A portion of a network that shares a common address component.  For example, all devices with IP addresses that start with 100.100.100. would be part of the same subnet.
		Dividing a network into subnets is useful for both security and performance reasons.
Subnet mask: is a mask used to determine what subnet an IP address belongs to.
Work Group: collection of systems each with their own rules and local user logins tied to that particular system.
			similar to a P2P network- each member is its own island and chooses what it decides to share with the rest of the network.
Domain: is a collection of systems with a centralized authentication server that tells them what the rules are. It is standard client/server relationship- the individual members
		of the domain connect to a central server which handles the heavy lifting and standardization of sharing and access permissions.
ifconfig: sysadmin tool in Unix-like O.S for N/w interface configs. Features: configuring, controlling, and querying TCP/IP network interface parameters
Telnet: would allow the admin to connect into remote devices and administer them via a command prompt. telnet transmits its data in cleartext (like ftp)
		used to see if a program is listening on a particular port.
/etc/passwd is the primary file in Unix/Linux operating system that stores information about user accounts and can be read by all users.

DNS Flow:	Domain Name Service to resolve Host Name to Ip Address and vice-versa. PORT: 53
			https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/	https://www.verisign.com/en_US/website-presence/online/how-dns-works/index.xhtml
DNS Config File: etc/resolv.conf Lists name servers used by host for DNS resolution; Restart to get the changes effect: service network restart
/etc/hosts: map hostnames(domains) to IP addresses. scope is local to your system; /etc/nsswitch.conf :specifies the lookup order with the hosts entry.
A Record: Address records assign IP address to domain names.
CNAME: Aliases for domain names
PTR: Pointer Record is used to translate IP address to Domain name.
Name Server: Keeps info about translation of Domain names to IP address and vice-versa. It performs at the request of resolver or another name server.
Resources Records: Contains information regarding host names and their IP address along with other information distributed via DNS.
TTL: Time to Live is the time the RR can be kept alive in a server cache.
DNS TYPES:
	A Record: Address Record assigns IP Address to Domain Names.
	C Name: provide Alias name to Domain names.
Round Robin DNS: used for Load balancing the load of distributed web servers.  
Dynamic DNS: method of keeping a domain name linked to changing IP Address.
Primary Name Server/Master Server: main data source and authoritative server for the zone. aquires data about its zone from databases saved on local disk.
Forward Lookup: Domain name - IP address | Reverse Lookup : IP Address - Domain name

SonarQube:
---------
Web based code Quality analysis tool for Maven based Java Projects. checks for Duplications, Code Bugs, Coding standards, Unit tests
Default port: 9000
components: Plugins: for various languages
	Scanner: It analyze projects on Continuous Integration Servers
	Server:  
	DB:  stores configuration of the SonarQube instance like security settings and they also store project quality snapshot.
Process: Developer commits code --> Jenkins build --> Execute Sonar Scanner for Analysis --> Report sent to SonarQube Server for processing 
			--> Stores result in DB and display in UI

Maven:
-----
project management tool that providers complete build lifecycle framework. used for compile, build, deploy, unit tests, create prject docs and reports.
Build Life Cycle: Clean(deletes the target directory with all the build data before starting the build process.)
	Validate: validate the project and check if everything is correct and all necessary information is available.
	Compile: compiles the source code of your project.
	Test: tests the compiled source code by using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code to be packaged or deployed.
	package: takes the compiled code and packages it in its distributable format(jar, war or ear).
	integration-test: processes and deploys the package if possible into an environment where integration tests can be run.
	verify: runs any checks to verify the package is valid and meets the required quality criteria.
	Install: installation of the package into the local repository. This is done to use it as a dependency in other projects locally.
	deploy: done in integration or release environment. final package is copied to remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
POM.xml(Project Object Model): Collection of dependencies information of a project
	collection of project dependencies, plugins(build, reporting)
	build profiles: set of configuration values that can be used to set or override default values of Maven build. 
	goals: represents a specific task that contributes to the building and managing of a project. It is bound to zero or more build phases.
Maven Repo: A repository is a directory where all the project jars, library jar, plugins or any other project specific artifacts are stored
	and this can be used by Maven easily - Local: folder location that is present on your machine where you can find your project’s all dependencies. ~/m2./repository
	Central: Maven community which contains of a huge collection of commonly used lib's. When Maven does not find any dependency in local repository, searches here.
	Remote: Dev's own custom repository containing required libraries or other project jars. Ex: Nexus, Artifacctory.
Maven vs Ant: Project management tool | Build tool; pom.xml | build.xml; can reuse plugins | cant reuse sripts; declarative steps | Procedural ;
	has Life Cycle | no life cycle; framework | toolbox
Snapshot: SNAPSHOT can be defined as a special version that indicates a current development copy. Unlike the regular versions, Maven checks for a new SNAPSHOT
	version in its remote repository.
project’s fully qualified artifact name: <groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>
