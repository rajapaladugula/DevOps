    c) Connection Time out (SSH listening on 22? check /etc/ssh/sshd_config; Check inbound rules in SG
            Firewall Rules? check $firewall-cmd --list-services/ports | iptables -nL
    d) Connection Refused? (SSH Service Running? service ssh status, listening on 22?)

DevOps:
DevOps is a set of cultural norms and technology practices that enable the fast flow of planned work, right from development, through tests into operations while preserving world class reliability, operation and security that involves Continuous Development, Continuous Testing, Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring of the software throughout its development life cycle.
Need: Now a days, Instead of releasing big sets of features, companies are trying to see if small features can be transported to their customers through a series of release trains.
         This has many advantages like quick feedback from customers, better quality of software etc. which in turn leads to high customer satisfaction. In order to achieve this, companies
         are required to: Increase deployment frequency, Lower failure rate of new releases, Shortened time between fixes, Faster mean time to recovery in the event of new release crashing.
         DevOps fulfills all these requirements and helps in achieving seamless software delivery.
Roll back strategy: Backup current artifact before deployment; Follow Blue-Green Deployments(Traffic switch); Canary Deployments(traffic split based on weight); Rolling(Rolling out new version of app one instance/container at a time); Document rollback procedures.
DR Strategy:  a) Maintain replica(standby) of current Environment and DNS switch to D.B connection when required.
                             b) Maintain multiple Availability zones across Regions & Load Balance traffic based on health checks.
                             c) DNS based switch to route traffic on basis of health checks.
Agile | DevOps:  a) Agility in Dev | both Dev & Operations
                    b) emphasize on timeliness | both timeliness & quality
                    c) feedback from customers | self-monitoring
                    d) practices: scrum, Kanban | CI, CT, CD, CM
Continuous integration (CI) is a process that implements testing on every change, enabling users to see if their changes break anything in the environment. 
Continuous delivery (CD) is the practice of building software in a way that allows you to deploy any successful release candidate to production at any time.
Continuous deployment (CD) takes continuous delivery a step further. With continuous deployment, every successful change is automatically deployed to production.

On-premise to Cloud Migration?: In one of my projects there was a requirement to migrate on-premise database to AWS RDS. Steps: 1. Create a new dB on AWS RDS
	2. Enable Security group access: Inbound add port 3306(mysql) 3. Disable(Maintenance mode) write access to the app so that existing and new dB's stay in-sync.
	4. Export app dB from existing and Import to new dB: using cmdline(mysqldump) or DB Client(SQLWorkbench) 5. Update the new dB configs in the app and re-enable write access.

Reduce Infra deployment time?: Back in a project to which I handled CI/CD operations, I observed that the process which we had in place for automation release testing was taking a lot of time and causing resource capacity issues as it was running on a stand-alone instance that even resulted in jumping project deadlines. I along with my colleague then came up with a solution to move the monolith architecture to docker microservices that requires collaboration with developers to break down the process to several micro processes that can run in parallel which resulted in a faster release cycle decreasing the time to complete the testing by 40%.

Optimized Cloud costs?: Implemented Scheduled Autoscaling for AWS ECS services in Dev, QA env Clusters that descales the unused containers overnight, which saved more than 40% cloud billing costs.

DevOps Automations?: CI/CD Pipelines, Database backups to S3, Jenkins Jobs to do URL monitoring, Infrastructure creation.

Best Practices for Ideal CI/CD: Use Dynamic variables to prioritize reusable code; Use flexible tooling that can adopt to evolving directions; Change Management to create consistency; 'X' as code with version control; Enable CI/CD Pipelines; Continuous Monitoring to gain operational insights; Robust, Scalable infrastructure; AZ-Availability with automated backups; Micro-service Architecture; Commit daily & Release often; Automate wherever possible; 

Configuration Management:
1. Ansible/Chef:
      a) Agent-less | Agent, Agent-less
      b) ymal | Ruby

(Infrastructure as Code)Terraform:
		Tool for building, changing and versioning infrastructure as a Code safely and effectively. Declarative language(define WHAT end result you want)
1. Use cases: a) Disposable Env's (QA, UAT)
			 b) Mutli-Cloud Deployment (AWS, Azure)
			 c) n-tier Applications :  tiers can be scaled independently
			 d) Self-service Clusters(Developers, QA)
			 e) Resource Schedulers (K8) as providers 
2. Providers: responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources (AWS, Azure, GCP, Grafana)
3. Resources: describes the infrastructure components such as virtual networks, instances...
4. Module: Container for multiple resources used together. Every tf has at least 'root' module. Ex: VPC module that creates the whole stack required.
5. Data sources: Allows data to be fetched or computed defined outside of terraform, or defined by other tf module. Query's external sources and return data. Ex: To get latest EC2 AMI
6. State: Stores information about managed infrastructure and configuration. default location is "terraform.tfstate". Without state, Terraform has no way to identify the real resources it created during previous runs. Thus, when multiple people are collaborating on shared infrastructure, it's important to store state in a shared location backend. Supports Backends; gcs, s3...
7. Workspaces: Containers for state. Used to manage Infrastructure environments(Dev, QA..) using same config files. tf starts with 'default' workspace.
8. Lifecycle: Nested block within resource. create_before_destroy(replacement created first), prevent_destroy(don’t destroy this resource), ignore_changes(future changes must be ignored)
9. Provisioners: Used to execute scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation or destruction and run configuration management. (local, remote, chef, puppet, file)
10. Steps for EC2 creation: VPC, Subnets, Security Group, EC2 instances, Load Balancer, DNS
11. Stages:   init - Initialize a Terraform working directory
		 refresh - query infra provider to get current state
		 plan - Generate and show an execution plan
		 validate - Validates the Terraform files
		 apply - Builds or changes infrastructure
		 destroy - Destroys Terraform-managed infrastructure

Infrastructure as Code vs Configuration Management:
Infra: Immutable(either recreated or destroyed but not changed) | Mutable (changes occurs "in-place" only if a resource does not match changed requirements)
Code Style: Declarative(specify step-by-step to achieve desired end state) | procedural(write code that specifies end state, but not how to achieve it)
Infra State: represents latest state | not fully captured in the code
Master: Master-less | Requires master(excluding Ansible)
Agents: No(typically already installed taken care by cloud providers) | Requires 

Jenkins:
Plugins: Git, SVN, Maven, Trigger build on other project, Deploy ear/war to container, Upstream/Downstream jobs, E-mail notification.
Pipeline: A Pipeline is a user-defined model of a CD pipeline. A Pipeline’s code defines your entire build process, which typically includes stages for building an application, testing it and then delivering it.
Pipeline Adv: User defined process, Pipeline as code in SCM, Audit trail for pipeline, Pausable(optionally stop and wait for human input or approval before continuing the Pipeline run), perform work in parallel, multiple options for integration with other plugins.
Node|Agent: A machine which is part of the Jenkins environment and is capable of executing a Pipeline.
Stage: A conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed through the entire Pipeline (e.g. "Build", "Test" and "Deploy" stages), which is used by many plugins to visualize or present Jenkins Pipeline status/progress.
Step: A single task. Fundamentally, a step tells Jenkins what to do at a particular point in time (or "step" in the process) For example, to execute the shell command make use the sh step: sh 'make'.
Declarative: Opens with a "pipeline" block with agent, stages and steps inside respective stages.
	pipeline {
    agent any                        # Execute this pipeline or any of its stages, on any available agent.
    stages {
        stage('Build') {            # Defines the "Build" stage.
            steps {
                sh 'make'                          # Perform steps related to build stage.
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { 
            steps {
                sh 'make check'
	               junit 'reports/**/*.xml'
	            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') { 
            steps {
                sh 'make publish' 
            }
        }
    }
}
Scripted: Opens with a "node" block with stages and steps inside respective stages.
Comparison: Scripted pipeline written in Groovy | Declarative pipeline doesn't require groovy; Starts with node block | starts with pipeline block; imperative programming model | uses declarative programming model; declarative provides richer syntactical features over Scripted Pipeline syntax
Best Practices: Reduce similar pipeline steps repetition(Combine them into single step or script); Avoid complex Groovy code in pipelines; Avoid calls to Jenkins API's from pipeline to avoid sever security and performance issues; Avoid large global variable declaration files(create small variable files relevant to current execution); Avoid large shared libraries(increases memory overhead and slower execution time).

Connect Jenkins slave(Windows) to Master: https://support.cloudbees.com/hc/en-us/articles/217423827-How-to-Install-Several-Windows-Slaves-as-a-Service-
Securing Jenkins: Access Control using 1.Security Realm informs Jenkins how and where to pull user info, also called Authentication(ActiveDirectory, LDAP) and 2.Authorization Strategy informs Jenkins which users or groups can access which aspects of Jenkins, and to what extent(Matrix-based | Project-based Matrix Authorization); Enable Prevent CSRF(enables unauthorized 3rd party to perform request against web app impersonating another authenticated user(Cross Site Request Forgery)); Secure JENKINS_HOME; Make sure to not allow non-admins to use Script Console. https://jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/security/
Jenkins HA: HAProxy provides an external load balancer and reverse proxy that receives traffic from users, determines the primary JVM based on heartbeat, then direct them to the active primary JVM.
Backup & Restore: Backup using a free-style project using custom shell script to push contents of JENKINS_HOME to AWS S3 (or) use Thin-Backup Plugin; Restore the backup to JENKINS_HOME and restart Jenkins.

Elasticsearch:
	It is a search engine based on Apache Lucene that supports full-text search engine to perform a fast incisive search over large chunks of data.
Adv: open-source, distributed, scalable and easy to integrate, compatible on any platform, supports every document type except text rendering, great for NoSQL db.
	 data analytics(find out anomalies on data based on pattern), logging(send alerts when particular condition matched like exception from logs) etc.
DisAdv: Elasticsearch does not support multiple languages while handling request and response data in JSON. In rare cases, it has a problem of Split Brain situations.
Split Brian: For avoiding the split-brain situation, the first parameter we can look at is discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes. This parameter determines how many nodes need to be in communication in order to elect a master. The rule of thumb is that this should be set to N/2 + 1, where N is the number of nodes in the cluster. For example in the case of a 3 node cluster, the minimum_master_nodes should be set to 3/2 + 1 = 2 (rounding down to the nearest integer).
 https://blog.trifork.com/2013/10/24/how-to-avoid-the-split-brain-problem-in-elasticsearch/
Index: An index in ES is similar to a db in relational databases. It's a collection of documents with similar characteristics and is identified by name. An index maps one or more multiple shards and can have zero or many replica shards.
Type(Table): It is a logical category/partition of index, defined for docs that have a set of common fields. Convenient way to store several types of data in the same index, in order to keep the total number of indices low.
Document(Row): A document in elastic search is a top level or a root component object that is serialized into JSON object and will be stored in Elastic search under a unique id. Documents in elastic search are indexed and stored and will be available to search using the index.
Inverted Index:  Primary goal is to make very fast full-text searches, while finding the documents in which our search terms occur. Inverted index consists of a list of all unique words that occurs in documents and for each word, maintain a list of documents number and positions in which it appears. It is a HashMap like data structure that directs users from a word to a document or a web page.
Shards: Data in an index can be partitioned into multiple portions which are itself fully-functional and independent index managed by a separate node of ES. Each such portion is called a shard. And an Elasticsearch index has 5 shards by default.
Replicas: Each shard in elastic search has again copies of the shard that are called the replicas. They serve the purpose of fault tolerance and high availability.
Operations: Indexing, Fetch, Delete, Update.
Cluster: Collection of one or more nodes (servers) that together holds your entire data and provides federated indexing and search capabilities across all nodes. 
Node: It is a single server that is part of the cluster. It stores the data and participates in the clusters indexing and search capabilities.
	  A Master node is a node that controls the entire cluster. A data node is a node that holds data in it and performs logical operations on the data.
	  Ingest node pre-process(applies transformations) documents before the actual document indexing happens. The ingest node intercepts bulk and index requests.
Analyzer: While indexing data in Elasticsearch, data is transformed internally by the Analyzer defined for the index. Analyzers are composed of a single Tokenizer and zero or more Token Filters(lower case). The tokenizer may be preceded by one or more Char Filters. Ex: Whitespace, stop; Filters:  AND, EXISTS, OR
Schema: A schema is a structure that describes multiple fields that provides the detailed overview of the document and its type and the way of handling the fields inside the document.
Tokenizer: Tokenizers are used to break a string down into a stream of terms or tokens. A simple tokenizer might split the string up into terms wherever it encounters whitespace or punctuation. 
Document API'S::
Create/Update Index: PUT <Index_Name>
List Index: GET /<Index_Name>/<doc_name>
Delete Index: DELETE /<Index_Name>/<doc_name>
Search APIS:: GET /<Index_Name>/<doc_name>/_search?q=year:2001
Index APIS:: Indexes of Cluster: GET /<Index_Name>/indices
Cluster APIS: GET _cluster/health
Add mapping in index: POST website /_bulk
Elasticsearch REST API Uses: Check your cluster, node, and index health, status, and statistics. Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) and search operations against your indexes.
X-Pack: X-Pack is an Elastic Stack extension that provides Security(password-protect by integrating with AD), Alerting(X-Pack), Monitoring(health and performance data of ELK components), reporting, machine learning, and many other capabilities.
Watcher: Watcher is the alerting and notification tool for Elasticsearch that lets you take action based on changes in your data. It is designed around the principle that if you can query something in Elasticsearch, you can alert on it; Components: trigger, input, condition, transform and action.
Data Flow: Application Logs --> Logstash --> Kafka(Zoo Keeper) --> Streamsets --> ElasticSearch --> Kibana|Grafana

Tomcat:
Best Practices:
	Run as a service, Download executable from the trusted source, Enable SSL(Secure socket layer to provide communications security over computer n/w's)
,Secure the Tomcat Manager application, Use Complex passwords, Create individual log file to each application, Encrypt passwords or sensible information, Update error pages relevantly, Rotate the log files, Disable shutdown port, Web Application Firewall.

Config Files: Location(TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml|web.xml)

GitHub:
Best Practices: 
	Don’t just git push directly to master. (turn on git branch protection to prevent direct commits)
	Commit early and often. (help understand how you broke something.)
	Avoid Rebase while sharing branch with other people.
	Do git commit with the right email address. (Having commits with unrecognized authors makes it more difficult to track )
	Define Code/Repo owners for faster code reviews.
	Don’t let secrets leak into source code. (inject secrets as environment variables; use Harshicorp Vault/AWS Secret Manager)
	Don’t commit dependencies into source code. (Use Nexus/Artifactory)
	Don’t commit configuration files into source code.
	Create a meaningful git ignore file. (helps to ignore pre-defined files liked secret keys)
	Archive dead repositories. (avoid risk of people using unmaintained repos)
	Lock package version. (specify a version or version range for every package and dependency listed in the manifest)
	Align packages versioning. (try at a minimum to use the same major version of the package.)

Networking:
HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol used by web pages to transmit website content and allow for display & navigation of hypertext or links to web browser. Protocol: TCP; Port:80
HTTPS: Secure HTTP is designed to be used for identity verification. It uses SSL certs to verify the server connecting to. Protocol: TCP; Port: 443
FTP: File Transfer Protocol is primarily designed for large file transfers, with capability of resuming downloads if interrupted.
	 DisAdv: credentials of the user are transmitted in cleartext. SFTP (FTP over SSH) and FTPS (FTP with SSL) overcomes this issue. FTP uses TCP ports: 20 and 21.
SSH: Secure Shell is designed to create secure tunnel between devices, so that even insecure programs can be used in secure state. TCP PORT: 22
Telnet: Allows the admin to connect into remote devices and administer them via a command prompt. telnet transmits its data in cleartext (like ftp). Used to see if a program is listening on a particular port. Port: 23
DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is default way for connecting up to a N/W. Upon connecting to a network, a DHCP request will be sent out from a new member system and the DHCP server will respond and issue an address lease for a varying amount of time. If the system connects to another network, it will be issued a new address by that server.
TCP: Transmission Control Protocol is used by HTTP, FTP, SSH and many other. TCP establishes connection on both ends before any data begins to flow. It is also able to sync up the data flow so that if packet arrives out of order, the receiving system is able to figure out what the packet is supposed to look like.
UDP: User Datagram Protocol is connectionless protocol, which doesn't care if other end is listening. Faster transmission speed than TCP. Ex; Television broadcast
ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol primary purpose is to tell systems when they are trying to connect remotely if the other end is available. Used by PING.
OSI Layers: Physical, Datalink, N/w, Transport, Session, Presentation and Application.

Firewall: is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on pre-determined security rules. Can be both S/W(Iptables, FirewallD)
		  Rules - ACCEPT, DROP and REJECT. and H/W(Routers). (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-a-firewall-and-how-does-it-work)
		  Flush IP Tables (Temp): iptables -f ; permanent: service iptables save; /etc/sysconfig/iptables: iptables
Proxy server: is a computer on the web that redirects your web browsing activity under a different IP address, identity not revealing their true access point to website.
Subnet: A portion of a network that shares a common address component. For example, all devices with IP addresses that start with 100.100.100. would be part of the same subnet. Dividing a network into subnets is useful for both security and performance reasons.
Subnet mask: is a mask used to determine what subnet an IP address belongs to.
Work Group: Collection of systems each with their own rules and local user logins tied to that particular system. Similar to a P2P network- each member is its own island and chooses what it decides to share with the rest of the network.
Domain: is a collection of systems with a centralized authentication server that tells them what the rules are. It is standard client/server relationship- the individual members of the domain connect to a central server which handles the heavy lifting and standardization of sharing and access permissions.

DNS Flow: Domain Name Service to resolve Host Name to Ip Address and vice-versa. PORT: 53
			https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/	https://www.verisign.com/en_US/website-presence/online/how-dns-works/index.xhtml
DNS Config File: etc/resolv.conf - Lists name servers used by host for DNS resolution; Restart to get the changes effect: $service network restart
/etc/hosts: map hostnames(domains) to IP addresses. scope is local to your system; /etc/nsswitch.conf :specifies the lookup order with the hosts entry.
PTR(Pointer Record): used to translate IP address to Domain name.
Name Server: Keeps info about translation of Domain names to IP address and vice-versa. It performs at the request of resolver or another name server.
Resources Records: Contains information regarding host names and their IP address along with other information distributed via DNS.
TTL(Time to Live): The length of time that a DNS record is cached on either the Resolving server or the users own local PC is equal to value of TTL in seconds. The lower the time to live, the faster changes to DNS records take to propagate throughout the internet.
DNS TYPES::
A Record(Address Record): assigns IP address to domain names.
CNAME: A Canonical Name can be used to resolve one domain name to another; Aliases for domain names.
Round Robin DNS: Used for Load balancing the load of distributed web servers.  
Dynamic DNS: Method of keeping a domain name linked to changing IP Address.
Primary Name Server/Master Server: main data source and authoritative server for the zone. acquires data about its zone from databases saved on local disk.
Forward Lookup: Domain name --> IP address | Reverse Lookup : IP Address --> Domain name

SonarQube:
Web based code Quality analysis tool for Maven based Java Projects. Checks for Duplications, Code Bugs, Coding standards, Unit tests
Default port: 9000
Components:: Plugins: for various languages.
	Scanner: It analyze projects on Continuous Integration Servers.
	Server:  
	DB:  Stores configuration of the SonarQube instance like security settings and they also store project quality snapshot.
Process: Developer commits code --> Jenkins build --> Execute Sonar Scanner for Analysis --> Report sent to SonarQube Server for processing --> Stores result in DB and display in UI

Maven:
Project management tool that provides complete build lifecycle framework. Used for compile, build, deploy, unit tests, create project docs and reports.
Build Life Cycle: 
	Clean(deletes the target directory with all the build data before starting the build process.)
	Validate: validate the project and check if everything is correct and all necessary information is available.
	Compile: compiles the source code of your project.
	Test: tests the compiled source code by using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code to be packaged or deployed.
	Package: takes the compiled code and packages it in its distributable format(jar, war or ear).
	Integration-test: processes and deploys the package if possible into an environment where integration tests can be run.
	Verify: runs any checks to verify the package is valid and meets the required quality criteria.
	Install: installation of the package into the local repository. This is done to use it as a dependency in other projects locally.
	Deploy: done in integration or release environment. final package is copied to remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
POM.xml(Project Object Model): Collection of project dependencies, plugins(clean, compler, deploy, sunfire…)
	build profiles: set of configuration values that can be used to set or override default values of Maven build. 
	goals: represents a specific task that contributes to the building and managing of a project. It is bound to zero or more build phases.
Maven Repo: A repository is a directory where all the project jars, library's, plugins or any other project specific artifacts are stored and this can be used by Maven easily
	Local: folder location that is present on your machine where you can find your project’s all dependencies. ~/m2./repository
	Central: Maven community which contains of a huge collection of commonly used lib's. When Maven does not find any dependency in local repository, searches here.
	Remote: Dev's own custom repository containing required libraries or other project jars. Ex: Nexus, Artifactory.
Maven vs Ant: Project management tool | Build tool; pom.xml | build.xml; can reuse plugins | cant reuse scripts; declarative steps | Procedural ;
	has Life Cycle | no life cycle; framework | toolbox
Snapshot: SNAPSHOT can be defined as a special version that indicates a current development copy. Unlike the regular versions, Maven checks for a new SNAPSHOT
	version in its remote repository.
Project’s fully qualified artifact name: <groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>

SQL Query:

BitBucket: has a separate Installation directory(BB is actually installed) and home directory(BB data is stored).
