--------------------------HOW TO PUSH AN IMAGE TO ECR ---------------------------------

1. To push an image to ECR, Initially we need to create a repository in ECR. To do that
   Open ECS -> Repositories -> Create Repository -> Repository name -> Next-> Repo created.

2. Now  Retrieve the docker login command that you can use to authenticate your Docker client to your registry.
   Open your server in putty and enter the below command.
   $ aws ecr get-login --region us-west-2

3. Now you will get big data as authentication. Copy that and paste it as a command. Then you will see "Login Succeeded".

4. Now in order to push an image to your repository. Initially you need to build it. Before building you need to put
   a Dockerfile in an directory, So that we can give the path of that directory.

5. Now enter build command in the putty as follows:
   $ docker build -t 886431691000.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecr:1.0  /home/ec2-user/tomcat/

886431691000.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecr -> This is the path of your ecr repo. Says where it should get pushed.
/home/ec2-user/tomcat/ -> This is the path of your Dockerfile
1.0 -> This is just a tag.

6. After entering that command it says build successfull. Build will be done according to your Dockerfile.

7. Now you need to push it to your repo. To do that enter :
   $ docker push 886431691000.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecr:1.0

8. It shows the layers of the images get pushing. And thats it you will get the image build to your repository. 

9. After this, If you want to get the same image pulled. You dont need to get this from dockerhub repo. You can pull
   the image from your repository. To do so 
   $ docker pull 886431691000.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecr:1.0
                         (or)
   $ docker pull 886431691000.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecr@digest

   digest: This you can find in your ECR repo


----------------------------SOME MORE COMMAND ON CLI-----------------------------------------

1. To list your repos in ECR -> $ aws ecr describe-repositories
   This shows the entire list of your repos with their name, ARN, ID, URI etc. 

2.
