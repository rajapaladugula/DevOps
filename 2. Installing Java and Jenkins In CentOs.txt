                          HOW TO DOWNLOAD JENKINS IN CENTOS

1.Now Open putty and login to redhat linux system and give follwing commands to install jenkins.

2.First you need to check update of the centos by typing (Sudo yum update)
  Sudo- Super user do. To install anything in linux system the user must me superuser. So we need to set user to sudo
  yum- Yum is a repository nothing but a database

3. Now we need to setup java virtual machine before installing jenkins because jenkins works on java.
   To install java first we need to install wget.
   ($ sudo yum install wget)

4. After that now change directory where you need your java to be installed and download linux by using these commands.
   ($ cd /opt/)
   ($ sudo wget --no-cookies --no-check-certificate --header "Cookie: gpw_e24=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oracle.com%2F; oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" "http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u121-b13/e9e7ea248e2c4826b92b3f075a80e441/jdk-8u121-linux-x64.tar.gz")
   ($ sudo tar -xvzf jdk-8u121-linux-x64.tar.gz)

5. After unzipping archive file you must give the following command to install java
   ($ cd /opt/jdk1.8.0_121/)
   ($ sudo alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jdk1.8.0_121/bin/java 2)
   ($ sudo alternatives --config java)

6. After this select a program that provides java.

7. At this point java is installed. Now you need to setup javac and jar command path alternatives.
   ($ sudo alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar jar /opt/jdk1.8.0_121/bin/jar 2)
   ($ sudo alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /opt/jdk1.8.0_121/bin/javac 2)
   ($ sudo alternatives --set jar /opt/jdk1.8.0_121/bin/jar)
   ($ sudo alternatives --set javac /opt/jdk1.8.0_121/bin/javac)

8. Now configuring environment variables.
   ($ export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_121)
   ($ export JRE_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_121/jre)
   ($ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/jdk1.8.0_121/bin:/opt/jdk1.8.0_121/jre/bin)

9. Now installing Jenkins
   (sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo)
   (sudo rpm --import http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins-ci.org.key)
   (sudo yum install jenkins)

10. To start jenkins and allow it to run use the following commands
   (sudo systemctl start jenkins.service)
   (sudo systemctl enable jenkins.service)

11. After that we need to allow the inbound traffic. As follows
   
   -> Open ec2 instance 
   -> On dashboard, select N/w security
   -> Under N/w security, select security group and then go to sg you created.
   -> And then click inbound and then edit
   -> Add rule Type: Custom TCP rule, Port range: 8080 and then save.

12. Now copy Ipv4public ip and then give :8080 (public ip:8080) in the url coloumn of the web browser.

13. It will ask for the password. Copy the link given and open putty and type
    ( sudo cat copiedlink)
    You will get password. 

14. Install plugins needed and its done.
