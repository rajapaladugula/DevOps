---------------Installing Bamboo on CentOs------------------

1. Install java is a pre-requisite and set path for JAVA_HOME:
  $ java -version
  $ echo $JAVA_HOME

2. Create a dedicated user to run Bamboo:
  $ sudo /usr/sbin/useradd --create-home --home-dir /usr/local/bamboo --shell /bin/bash bamboo

3. Download the tar.gz file for your operating system (30 day trial):
  $ sudo wget https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/downloads/binary/atlassian-bamboo-6.6.3.tar.gz

4. Extract the downloaded file to an install location and refer it as <Bamboo installation directory>
  $ tar -xvzf atlassian-bamboo-6.6.3.tar.gz

5. Create your Bamboo home directory, which should be different from <Bamboo installation directory> to store Bamboo data.

6. Open <Bamboo installation directory>/atlassian-bamboo/WEB-INF/classes/bamboo-init.properties and update the home directory path.

7. Running Bamboo as a service: Create a bamboo.service file in your /etc/systemd/system directory

[Unit]
Description=Atlassian Bamboo
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=<bamboo-user>
ExecStart=<bamboo-install>/bin/start-bamboo.sh
ExecStop=<bamboo-install>/bin/stop-bamboo.sh
SuccessExitStatus=143

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

The values for <bamboo-user> and <bamboo-install> should be replaced with your Bamboo user and the path to your Bamboo Install directory, respectively.

Enable the service to start at boot time by running the following in a terminal:
systemctl enable bamboo.service

Stop Bamboo using the provided Bamboo stop script (<bamboo-install>/bin/stop-bamboo.sh) and restart your system to check that Bamboo starts as expected
