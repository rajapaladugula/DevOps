------------------------HOW TO BUILD A JENKINS JOB WHEN MERGE HAPPENS IN GITHUB------------------------------

1. First you need to create a repository in git and a new job in jenkins.

2. In order to build automatically, Initially You need to  add a webhook in github.
   To add a webhook: Open your repository in git-->settings-->Webhooks-->Add webhook->In payload url(JENKINSURL/github-webhook/)
   Ex: (http://52.88.140.132:8082/github-webhook/)

3. This webhook helps to connect to jenkins.

4. Now open Your job in jenkins and then configure it.
  --> Check Github project and clone git repo url and paste in it. Remove .git in the end because its a repo url.
  --> Under source code management check git and clone same url in it.
  --> Under Build triggers check github hook trigger for GITScm polling
  --> Under Build-->Goals and options--> Give your requirement like "test" or "clean package" etc.
