----------------- HOW TO INSTALL MYSQLDB IN CENTOS AND CHANGE THE ROOT DIRECTORY OF MYSQLDB----------------


1. To install mysqldb in your centos, First you need to install mysql in your yum  repository. To do so, visit
   (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/yum/)  and search for the desired file named (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 /
    Oracle Linux 7 (Architecture Independent), RPM Package) in that site. 

2. Copy the code below that link. It will be like this (mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm) and type the 
   following command in your centos 
   $ sudo wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm

3. Once the rpm file is saved, we will verify the integrity of the download by running md5sum and comparing it with
   the corresponding MD5 value listed on the site. MD5:c070b754ce2de9f714ab4db4736c7e05

4. To check it type the following command $ (md5sum mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm). Then it will show
   you the MD5 number as the output. Verify it. 
   
   sudo rpm -ivh mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm

5. Now you added mysql in your yum repository. So to install mysqldb in your centos 
   $ (sudo yum install mysql-server)
   Press y to confirm that you want to proceed. Since we've just added the package, we'll also be prompted to accept
   its GPG key. Press y to download it and complete the install.

6. Next $ (sudo systemctl start mysqld) 
        $ (sudo systemctl status mysqld)

7. During the installation process, a temporary password is generated for the MySQL root user. Locate it in the 
   mysqld.log with this command:

   $ (sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log)

8. Make note of the password, which you will need in the next step. 

9. Enter $(sudo mysql_secure_installation) . This will prompt you for the default root password. As soon as you 
   enter it, you will be required to change it.

10. Enter the generated password and then set the new password and then hit y. we'll press Y and then ENTER to all
    the subsequent questions in order to remove anonymous users, disallow remote root login, remove the test 
    database and access to it, and reload the privilege tables.

11. Now that we've secured the installation. You can test by login to it 
    $(mysqladmin -u root -p)
    Enter the command above and then enter your password this will take you to mysql server.

------------------HOW TO CHANGE THE ROOT DIRECTORY OF MYSQL DB -----------------------------

1. Before making any changes, first make sure to stop mysql service by enter the command 
   $(sudo service mysqld stop)

2. The root directory of the mysqldb is (/var/lib/mysql). If you want to change that root directory to (/data). 
   Copy the files from /var/lib/mysql to /data by entering the following command: 
   $(sudo cp -rap /var/lib/mysql /data)

3. Now edit MySQL default configuration file /etc/my.cnf and update values of datadir and socket variable.

  Change From:
  datadir=/var/lib/mysql
  socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

  Change To: 
  datadir=/data
  socket=/data/mysql/mysql.sock

4. Add the SELinux security context to /data before restarting. To do so 
   $(sudo semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_db_t "/data(/.*)?")
   $(sudo restorecon -R /data)

5. Now go to /data. You will find a directory mysql in it and Simply delete ib_logfile0, ib_logfile1, ibdata1, 
   *.err, *.pid files from your new data directory. This is because the db will automatically generate those files
   on the startup. So MAKE SURE TO ERASE THEM.

6. Now start you db $(sudo service mysqld start). It will start without any problem. To check whether the data dir
   is changed or not. Enter the following command
   $ (mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT @@datadir;")  you will see your new root dir there.
